Imploder data files cruncher/decruncher.
Based on the reversed implode/explode routines from lab313ru.

Imploder packs quite well and the decruncher is relatively fast
and can decrunch in-place without any overhead.

68000 asm decruncher taken and improved from a Team 17 game.

Windows and Amiga executables provided.
